# Community-of-Interoperability-labs

This is the repository of shared materials from the AeHIN Community of Interoperability Labs (COIL)

Our goals are:

1. to deliver capacity-building activities in our respective countries for advocacy, learning, and improved adoption;

2.⁠ to document our learnings and lessons as a reusable global content for the community (think of white papers, git, Confluence pages, AI tools, etc.)

For starters, we will create folders per country, and later place tags #learn / #build / #connect
